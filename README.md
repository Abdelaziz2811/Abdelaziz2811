# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Abdelaziz  

An aspiring Full Stack Developer who thrives on learning, problem-solving, and building solutions from the ground up.

My journey began with mastering the fundamentals of programming through C++, data structures, and algorithms at Programming Advices, where I built a solid foundation to tackle technical challenges with confidence. Along the way, I developed several console-based applications and gradually expanded into C# and SQL Server, focusing on desktop development with the .NET Framework.

In July 2025, I successfully completed the Piscine program at 1337 School, a highly intensive training that sharpened my resilience, collaboration, and low-level programming skills. This experience strengthened my passion for software engineering and prepared me to dive deeper into C, shell scripting, and systems programming.
